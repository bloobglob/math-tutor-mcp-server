## Section 7.2: 2D Plane Sections from 3D Figures and 3D Measurement

### Section Overview:
The goal of this section is to help students better understand: a) attributes of various prisms, b) how those attributes affect finding the surface area and volume of different prisms, c) the relationship between measurements in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional figures and d) connect ideas of scale factor/percent change to ideas of surface area and volume. Students begin this section by examining three-dimensional figures. They should observe which faces for an object are parallel and/or perpendicular and which are the same size and shape. Students quickly move to taking cross-sections of various figures to notice what two dimensional shapes are generated by different types of cuts. Attention will be paid to when parallel plane sections generate surfaces that are the same and when they are different. The exercises in this section are designed to solidify students' understanding of the algorithms for finding perimeter, area, and volume. Additionally, exercises should help students better understand units of measure for perimeter, area, and volume. Next, students examine the nets of 3D figures. Nets were introduced in 6th grade; in 7th grade, students extend their understanding by differentiating surface area from volume. Students will use their understanding of surface area and volume to solve various problems. Specifically, attention will be paid to scale factor and percent change in problems involving volume and surface area.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards)
1. Describe the two-dimensional figures that result from slicing three dimensional figures.
2. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume and surface area of three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.

### Example Problems
1. The net to the right forms a cube. Each square face has a length of 4.2 cm.
a. What is the surface area of the cube?
b. What is the volume of the cube?
c. If you created a new cube with edge lengths that are 150% of the original cube what would the new surface area and volume be?
d. If you created a new cube with edge lengths that are 70% of the original cube what would the new surface area and volume be to the nearest tenth?

2. Katie purchased a box of crackers from the deli. The box is in the shape of an isosceles triangular prism shown below.
a. How much packaging material was used to construct the cracker box?
b. What is the volume of the box?

3. A tissue company uses tissue boxes that are rectangular prisms. The boxes have the dimensions: 10 inches long, 6 inches high, and 4 inches deep. The managers of the company want a new size for the tissue boxes. They have 3 requirements: The new boxes have to be rectangular prisms, use less cardboard than the original boxes, and have to hold the same or a greater volume of tissues as the original.
a. The company proposes a new tissue box with dimensions 12 inches long, 4 inches high, and 5 inches deep. Does this new box fit the requirements? Explain.
b. Give a possible set of dimensions for a new box. Explain why your box meets the requirements.

4. A cube with side lengths of 8 centimeters is enlarged so its side lengths are now 24 centimeters.
a. By what scale factor did the side lengths increase? Show your work or justify your answer.
b. By what scale factor will the surface area increase? Show your work or justify your answer.
c. By what scale factor did the volume increase? Show your work or justify your answer.
