## Section 1.1: Investigate Chance Processes. Develop/Use Probability Models

### Section Overview:
This is studentsâ€™ first formal introduction to probability. In this section students will study chance
processes, which concern experiments or situations where they know which outcomes are possible, but
they do not know precisely which outcome will occur at a given time. They will look at probabilities as
ratios expressed as fractions, decimals, or percents (part:whole). Probabilities will be determined by
considering the results or outcomes of experiments. They will learn that the set of all possible outcomes
for an experiment is a sample space. They will recognize that the probability of any single event can be
expressed in terms of impossible, unlikely, equally likely, likely, certain, or as a number between 0 and 1,
inclusive. Students will focus on two concepts in probability of an event: experimental and theoretical.
They will understand the commonalities and differences between experimental and theoretical probability
in given situations.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards)
1. Understand and apply likelihood of a chance event as between 0 and 1.
2. Approximate probability by collecting data on a chance process (experimental probability).
3. Calculate theoretical probabilities on a chance process.
4. Given the probabilities (different scenarios in a chance process), predict the approximate frequencies
for those scenarios (if experimenting on a chance process).
5. Use appropriate fractions, decimals and percents to express the probabilities.

### Example Problems
1. On the Bolts football team, one-fourth of the players walk to practice and 30% are driven by their
parents. The remaining players go by bus. If there are 60 players on the team who go to practice, how
many players take the bus?
2. Which of the following is NOT equivalent to the other three? Explain.
A. 0.15 B. 15/20 C. 75% D. 0.75
3. Explain the formulas for both Theoretical and Experimental Probabilities in words. How would you
explain the difference in the denominators?
4. At the sandwich shop you can choose from three types of bread, two types of meat, 3 types
of cheese. You must pick only one of each. How many different types of sandwiches can
be made?
