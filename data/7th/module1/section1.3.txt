## Section 1.3: Solve Percent Problems Including Discounts, Interest, Taxes, Tips, and Percent Increase or Decrease

### Section Overview:
In this section, students continue to solve contextual problems with fractions, decimals and percent but begin to transition from relying solely on models to writing numeric expressions. In future modules, students will extend their understanding by writing equations and proportions using variables.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards)
1. Use models to solve problems involving percent and fractions.
2. Solve percent problems involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, etc.
3. Solve percent problems involving percent increase and decrease.
4. Develop algebraic expressions and equations from percent and fraction models.

### Example Problems
