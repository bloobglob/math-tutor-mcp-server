## Section 6.1: Constructing Triangles from Given Conditions
### Section Overview:
In this section, students discover the conditions that must be met to construct a triangle. By constructing
triangles students will note that the sum of the two shorter lengths of a triangle must always be greater than
the longest side of the triangle, and that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. They then
explore the conditions for creating a unique triangle: three side lengths, two sides lengths and the included
angle, and two angles and a side length—whether or not the side is included. This approach of explore, draw
conclusions, and then seek the logical structure of those conclusions is integral to the new core. It is also the
way science is done. In later grades, students will more formally understand concepts developed here.
In 7th grade, students are to learn about “scaling.” The concepts in this section are foundational to scaling and
lead to proportional relations of objects that have the same “shape” in Section 6.2. In 8th grade, students will
extend the idea of scaling to dilation and then in high school to similarity. In this section emphasis should be
made on conditions necessary to create triangles and that conditions are related to knowing sides and angles.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards)
Geometry Standard 2: Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with
given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the
conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle. 7.G.2
Geometry Standard 6: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area
of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right
prisms. 7.G.6
1. Given specific criteria, construct a triangle and know if it’s a unique triangle.
2. Understand and explain the side length requirements of a triangle.
3. Understand and explain the angle and side requirements for constructing a unique triangle.
4. Know the angle measure requirements of a triangle. (Triangle Angle Sum Theorem)

### Example Problems
1. Derive a formula for the interior angle sum of a polygon with n sides.
2. Make a conjecture (rule). Based on your observations, write a conjecture about the relationship between
the sum of the measures of the shortest and medium sides of a triangle and the measure of the longest
side of the triangle. Provide a reason for your conjecture.
3. If two side lengths of a triangle are 5 cm and 7 cm, what is the largest possible whole number length of
the third side? Justify your answer.
4. Describe the relationship between the location of the shortest side and the location of the smallest angle of
the three triangles above.
