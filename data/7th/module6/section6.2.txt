## Section 6.2: Scale Drawings

### Section Overview:
The central idea of this section is scale and its relationship to ratio and proportion. Students will use ideas
about ratio, proportion, and scale to: (a) change the size of an image and (b) determine if two images are
scaled versions of each other.
By the end of this section, students should understand that we could change the scale of an object to suit our
needs. For example, we can make a map where 1 inch equals one mile; key out a floor plan where 2 feet
equals 1.4 cm from a diagram; or draw a large version of an ant where 3 centimeters equals 1 mm. In each of
these situations, the “shape characteristics” of the object remain the same, what has changed is size. Objects
can be scaled up or scaled down. Through scaling exercises, students will see that all dimensions of a given
object are changed by the same factor in the scaled representation and this factor is called the scale factor.
Here students continue to develop an intuitive understanding of “the same shape.” Throughout this section
students should clearly distinguish between two objects that are the same shape and dimension and objects
that are scaled versions of each other. In particular, students will come to understand that two polygonal
figures that are scaled versions of each other have equal angles and corresponding sides in a ratio of a:b,
where a ≠ b. Students should also distinguish between saying the ratio of object A to object B is a:b while the
scale factor from A to B is b/a. This idea links ratio and proportional thinking to scaling.
Students will learn to find the scale factor from one object to the other from diagrams, values and/or proportion
information. Students should be able to go fluidly from a smaller object to a larger scaled version, and from a
larger object to a smaller scaled version given either or both the proportional constant and/or the scale factor.
In this section and through the module, abstract procedures will be emphasized for finding scale factors and/or
missing lengths; however, some students may prefer to continue to use bar models. Bar model strategies will
become increasingly more cumbersome, so it will be important to help students transition to more efficient
procedures. This can be done by helping students connect concrete models (i.e. bar/tape models) to the
algorithmic procedure as was done in Module 4.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards):
Geometry Standard 1: Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric figures, including computing
actual lengths and areas from a scale drawing, and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale. 7.G.1
Geometry Standard 6: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area
of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right
prisms. 7.G.6
1. Draw a scaled version of a triangle, other polygon, or object given lengths.
2. Find a measure of a scaled object given the scale factor and measures from the original.
3. Find the scale factor between two objects that are the same shape but different sizes/proportional.
4. Use proportional reasoning in explaining and finding missing sides of objects that are the same shape but
different sizes.
5. Find the scale factors for perimeter and area for proportional objects.

### Example Problems
1. Sixty meters of fencing enclose a square corral. What is the area of the corral?
2. A model of an MC130E airplane has a scale factor of 1/100.
    a. If the model plane is one foot long, how long is the actual plane?
    b. If the actual wingspan is 1600 inches, how long is the model’s wingspan?
    c. If the width of each of the model’s propellers is 1.62 inches, how wide is an actual propeller?
3. Allen made a scale drawing of his rectangular classroom. He used the scale 1/4 inch = 4 feet. His actual
classroom has dimensions of 32 feet by 28 feet.
a. What are the dimensions of his scale drawing of the classroom?

b. What is the scale factor of classroom length : drawing length?

c. What is the scale factor of classroom area : drawing area?

d. What is the mathematical relationship between the scale factor for lengths and the scale factor for
areas?
