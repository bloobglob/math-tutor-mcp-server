## Section 5.3: Analyze and Use Proportional Relationships and Models to Solve Real-World and Mathematical Problems.

### Section Overview:
In this section, the concepts studied in Sections 5.1 - 5.2 will be applied to solve problems. The formal
definition of a proportion will be introduced, and students will set up and solve proportions for real-world
problems, including problems with percentages of increase and decrease. Itâ€™s likely, especially for
advanced classes, that before the topic is formally introduced students will set up proportions and solve
them (a) using properties of equality, (b) by finding a common denominator on both sides, or even (c) by
cross multiplying, if they have seen this in previous years or at home. Any method that can be justified
using proportional reasoning can lead to a meaningful discussion. Students should be encouraged to
justify their answer with other representations (graph, bar model, table, or unit rates) to bring out the
possible misconception that proportions can be solved with an additive rather than a multiplicative
strategy. (e.g ; but )
In addition to solving proportions algebraically, students will examine part-to-whole ratios and compare
them to the part-to-part ratios they have been using in the first three sections of the module. Odds and
probability will be used together to give students practice in fluently switching between part-to-part and
part-to-whole ratios and solving for missing quantities using either type of ratio.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from Standards):
1. Extend the concept of a unit rate to include ratios of fractions.
2. Compute a unit rate, involving quantities measured in like or different units.
3. Verify that two quantities expressed in a table or in a graph are in a proportional relationship.
4. Determine a unit rate from a table, graph, equation, diagram or verbal description and relate it to the
constant of proportionality.
5. Write an equation for a proportional relationship in the form y = kx.
6. Explain the meaning of the point (x, y) in the context of a proportional relationship.
7. Explain the significance of (0,0) and (1, r) in a graph of a proportional relationship, where r is the unit
rate.
8. Solve multistep problems involving percent using proportional reasoning.
9. Find the percent of a number and extend the concept to solving real life percent applications.
10. Calculate percent, percent increase, decrease, and error.

11. Solve multistep problems involving percent using proportional reasoning.
12. Find the percent of a number and extend the concept to solving real life percent applications.

### Example Problems:
1. Solve each proportion using cross-products. Be sure to show all work.
a. 26/(x+4)=5/3
b. (n-7)/18=5/9
2. Define a variable, write the units of your comparisons as a word ratio, then write a proportion equation
and solve. Answer the following in a complete sentence. Edgar and Raul participated in a team bike-athon. Edgar rode 6 out of every 7 miles in the course. Raul
covered the rest of the mileage. If Edgar rode 48 miles, how many miles did Raul ride?
3. The odds of selecting a green marble from a given bag are 5: 18. How many times would I need to
randomly select marbles in order to pull out a green marble 75 times?
4. A publisher receives $12.60 from each book sold. The remaining portion of the $15 selling price
goes to the author. What royalty rate does the author earn?
5. A survey found that 1950 people out of 3000 people polled read at least one newspaper per day. What
percent of the people polled do not read at least one newspaper per day?
