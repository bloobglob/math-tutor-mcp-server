## Section 5.1: Understand and Apply Unit Rates.

### Section Overview:
The purpose of this section is to solidify the concept of unit rates. This includes finding unit rates from a
context, table, graph and/or proportional relationship written as an equation. This section will begin the
work of helping students to move fluidly among these representations to find missing quantities. The
students will visualize ratios using models. Particular attention should be paid to models of rates with
unlike units (for example, miles and hours). Students will identify the unit rate for both units (i.e. miles per
hour and hours per mile.) Students should then be able to move away from using models and be able to
recognize the reciprocal relationship of the two unit rates to solve problems.
This section will also provide practice operations with rational numbers. The students should be
encouraged to find exact unit rates; i.e. they should be encouraged to use fractions to divide numbers,
rather than using long division or a calculator and getting decimal approximations. Students should
understand that using a rounded unit rate will give inaccurate results when finding missing quantities.
Up until this module, students worked primarily with part: whole relationships (percent, fractional portions,
and probability.) In this section, students will begin to connect how part: whole relationships give
information about part: part relationships and vice-versa.
Rate tables will be introduced but will be further explored and connected to graphs in the next section.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from standards):
1. Extend the concept of a unit rate to include ratios of fractions.
2. Compute a unit rate, involving quantities measured in like or different units.
3. Determine a unit rate from a table, graph, equation, diagram or verbal description and relate it to the
constant of proportionality.

### Example Problems
1. John walks at a constant rate of 8 miles every 3 hours. Answer the following:
    a. What is Johnâ€™s rate written as miles and hours?
    b. Use a bar model to find the unit rate of miles per hour. _____miles : 1 hour
    c. Use a bar model to find how far John can walk in 5 hours.
2. Compare Unit Rates: Calculate each unit rate to justify your comparisons and explain in words.
    a. Jean sells M&Ms to friends at 4 M&Ms for 5 cents. The machine at the store sells 9 M&Ms for 25 cents. Which is the better deal?
    b. Ribbon: 5 m for $6.45 or 240 cm for $3.19. Which ribbon is cheaper per meter? (1 m = 100 cm)
    c. Tomas hikes 10.2 miles in 2.7 hours and Sal hikes 13.1 miles in 3.5 hours. Who hikes faster?
