## Section 5.2: Analyze Proportional Relationships Using Unit Rates, Tables, Graphs, and Equations

### Section Overview:
In this section, students will connect the concept of proportionality to unit rates, tables, and graphs.
Students will first use unit rates to check for proportionality. They will then move into graphs and tables to
determine whether paired quantities are proportional. They will learn that proportional quantities always
make a straight line beginning at the origin when graphed, and that tables showing proportional quantities
will give a constant unit rate upon division of every pair of quantities. They will write equations to find
missing quantities, using the unit rate as the constant of proportionality. Throughout the section, there will
be problems with relationships that are not proportional to be used as contrast to those that are. By the
end of the section, students should be able to go from one representation to another representation (graph
to equation, equation to table, graph to table, etc.) and should be able to state what points on the graphs,
solutions to the equation, or entries on the table mean in the context of the problem. They will also
continue to explore the relationship between part:part and part: whole relationships (5.2B) with ideas
solidifying in Section 5.3.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered (from Standards):
1. Extend the concept of a unit rate to include ratios of fractions.
2. Compute a unit rate, involving quantities measured in like or different units.
3. Verify that two quantities expressed in a table or in a graph are in a proportional relationship.
4. Determine a unit rate from a table, graph, equation, diagram or verbal description and relate it to the
constant of proportionality.
5. Write an equation for a proportional relationship in the form y = kx.
6. Explain the meaning of the point (x, y) in the context of a proportional relationship.
7. Explain the significance of (0,0) and (1, r) in a graph of a proportional relationship, where r is the unit
rate.

### Example Problems
1. Draw bar models to determine if the two ratios are proportional.
    a. In one box of cookies, the ratio of chocolate chip cookies to oatmeal cookies is 3 to 8. A bigger box
    of cookies has a ratio of 12 chocolate chip to 32 oatmeal cookies.
    b. The ratio of cats to total pets in the first pet store is 3 to 9. In the second pet store the ratio of cats
    to total pets is 6 to 18.
2. Complete the graph for the table below. Be sure to label your axes with words. Draw a straight line
through the points if you can.
# of MP3s 2     3       4       5       6       10
Price ($) 1.00  1.50    1.75    1.90    2.00    5.00
    a. Are number of MP3s and price
    proportionally related in this situation?
    How do you know?

    b. State the independent and dependent
    variables.

    c. Examine the graph. What
    conclusions can you make?
3. Make a conjecture about how to determine if a graph of values represents a proportional relationship.
