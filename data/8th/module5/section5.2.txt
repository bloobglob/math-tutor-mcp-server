## Section 5.2: Volume of Cylinders, Cones, and Spheres
### Section Overview:
Throughout this section, students are solving real-world and mathematical problems involving volumes of cylinders, cones, and spheres. Students begin by deriving the volume of a cylinder, relying on their knowledge from previous grades that the volume of a right three-dimensional object can be found by taking the area of its base and multiplying it by the height. Students then use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to arrive at the formulas for the volumes of a cone and sphere. Using concrete models of these three-dimensional objects, students physically compare the volume of a cone to the volume of a cylinder. Students then manipulate the formula for the volume of a cylinder to reflect these differences, arriving at the formula for the volume of a cone. They use a similar process to derive the formula for the volume of a sphere. Once students understand where these formulas come from, they apply them to solve real-world problems, knowing when and how to use the formulas.
### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered:
By the end of this section students should be able to: Find the volume of a cylinder, cone, and sphere given a radius and height. Find a missing measurement (height, radius, or diameter) for a cylinder, cone, or sphere given the volume. Use the formulas for the volumes of cylinders, cones, and spheres to solve a variety of real-world problems.
### Example Problems:
1. Gunner started his summer job doing swimming pool maintenance. He has to do the following for each pool: Drain each pool. Build a cover for each pool and determine how much material is needed to cover each pool. After covering each pool, Gunner needs to fill the pools back up with water. He has to calculate how much water is needed to fill each pool to a depth of 1 meter, 2 meters, 3 meters and 4 meters.
2. For a science project, Jackson put out a can to collect rainwater. The can was 11 inches tall and had a diameter of 8 inches. If it rained exactly 20 cubic inches each day, how many days did it take to fill the can?
3. Salt and sand mixtures are often used on icy roads. When the mixture is dumped from a truck into the staging area, it forms a cone-shaped mound with a diameter of 10 feet and a height of 6 feet. What is the volume of the salt-sand mixture?
4. If a golf ball has a diameter of 4.3 centimeters and a tennis ball has a diameter of 6.9 centimeters, find the difference between the volume of the golf ball and the volume of the tennis ball.
