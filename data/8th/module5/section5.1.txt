## Section 5.1: Integer Exponents and Scientific Notation
### Section Overview:
This section begins with an overview of the structure of exponents and how an exponential expression represents repeated multiplication as opposed to expressions that represent repeated addition. Using the structure of an exponential expression, special properties or rules are discovered in this section. These exponent properties and rules aid in simplifying exponential expressions. Students informally prove why an exponent of zero equals one and also look at the definition of negative exponents. Once students become familiar with these properties and rules, they use them to simplify more complex exponential expressions. Later in the section, students learn that scientific notation is a way of expressing very large and very small numbers more efficiently. Students learn to change numbers between standard form and scientific notation in order to estimate very large and very small quantities. Applying exponent properties, students learn how to operate with numbers in scientific notation in order to compare and express how many times as much one is than the other. They problem solve using scientific notation, choosing units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities.
### Concepts and Skills to Master:
By the end of this section students should be able to: Apply the properties of integer exponents to simplify algebraic and numerical expressions. Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other. Convert numbers from scientific notation to standard form, from standard form to scientific, and from exponential to scientific. Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation. Choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities. Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology. Use scientific notation to problem solve with really small and really large numbers.
### Example Problems:
1. At Manuel's new job, the company is offering him two different options for his retirement plan. Option A: $100,000 the first year and then every year after that, he will get $100,000 more than the year before. Option B: $10 the first year, then every year after that, he will get 10 times as much as the year before. Complete the table below and determine what option should he choose.
2. The human body uses red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the organs. An average adult has about red blood cells. Each cell is meters long. If all the body's red blood cells were lined up, how many meters would it be?
3. In July 2017, Facebook was worth 500,000,000,000. Write this number in scientific notation.
4. The diameter of a human hair is 0.000099 meters wide. Write this number in scientific notation.
