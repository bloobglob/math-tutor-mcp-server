## Section 8.1: Rigid Motion and Congruence

### Section Overview:
In this section, students study the different types of rigid motion: translations, reflections, and rotations. Students begin with translations and describe them both in words and with coordinate rules. They explore reflections, including those over horizontal/vertical lines and the lines y = x and y = -x, and write coordinate rules. Then they study rotations, primarily in 90˚ increments, both at the origin and other points. Students describe sequences of rigid motions and use them to determine congruence.

### Concepts and Skills to be Mastered:
1. Describe translations using words and coordinate rules; perform translations.
2. Understand the properties and effects of translations.
3. Describe reflections using words and coordinate rules; perform reflections and identify lines of reflection.
4. Understand the properties and effects of reflections.
5. Describe and perform rotations, including around points not at the origin.
6. Understand the properties of rotations and connect them to perpendicular slopes.
7. Determine congruence based on rigid motions and describe the sequence of transformations showing congruence.

### Example Problems
1. On the grid below, the pre-image ABCD has been transformed to obtain the image A′B′C′D′. Write the coordinate rule that describes this translation.
2. Reflect pre-image ABCD over the y-axis. In the table, write the coordinates of the pre-image and image. Write a coordinate rule for the reflection.
3. Rotate triangle ABC 90° clockwise about the origin and write the coordinate rule. Verify with slope and distance formula.
4. Reflect triangle DEF over a line, and write the equation of the line of reflection.
